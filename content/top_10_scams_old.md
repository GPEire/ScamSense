## Your Golden Rule
**STOP – CHECK – TALK**  
- **STOP** – Don’t rush. Hang up. Close the message.  
- **CHECK** – Call the real company, family, or agency using a trusted number.  
- **TALK** – Share with a family member or friend before acting.  

Keep this motto in mind whenever something feels “off.”
